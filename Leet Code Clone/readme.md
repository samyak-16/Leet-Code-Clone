```bash
npx prisma init
```

This will create a new `prisma/` folder with a `schema.prisma` file inside, and also add a `.env` file at the root of your project.

If you haven't installed Prisma yet, first install it with:

```bash
npm install prisma --save-dev
```

And if you also want the Prisma Client to query your database:

```bash
npm install @prisma/client
```


docker run --name my-postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=myuser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
