```javascript
// Add readline for dynamic input handling
const readline = require('readline');
```
**ðŸ‘‰** This line **imports** Node.js's built-in `readline` module.  
It helps you **read user input** (like when someone types something in the console).

---

```javascript
const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
  terminal: false
});
```
**ðŸ‘‰** This creates an object `rl` (short for **readline interface**).  
It **connects** to the input (keyboard/console) and output (terminal screen).  
- `input: process.stdin` â†’ Reads **user typing**.
- `output: process.stdout` â†’ Writes output to **terminal**.
- `terminal: false` â†’ Tells it **not** to treat the input like a fancy terminal (just plain reading).

---

```javascript
rl.on('line', (line) => {
```
**ðŸ‘‰** This listens for a **'line'** event â€” whenever a user **types something and presses Enter**.  
The typed **line** is passed into the function as a parameter called `line`.

---

```javascript
  const result = isPalindrome(line);
```
**ðŸ‘‰** It **calls** a function `isPalindrome`, passing the user input (`line`) to check if it's a **palindrome**.  
(*Palindrome = word that reads same forward and backward, like "madam" or "racecar".*)

> âš¡ Note: You must have a function `isPalindrome` defined somewhere else.

---

```javascript
  console.log(result ? "true" : "false");
```
**ðŸ‘‰** Prints **"true"** if the result is `true`, otherwise prints **"false"`.  
- `result ? "true" : "false"` â†’ This is a **ternary operator** (shortcut if-else).

---

```javascript
  rl.close();
});
```
**ðŸ‘‰** After processing one line, it **closes** the `readline` interface.  
Means: No more inputs are accepted, program will finish.

# ðŸ’¡ Quick Summary:
| Step | What Happens |
|:---|:---|
| 1. | Import `readline`. |
| 2. | Create a way to read user input (`rl`). |
| 3. | Wait for user to type and press Enter. |
| 4. | Send what user typed into `isPalindrome()`. |
| 5. | Print "true" or "false" based on whether it's a palindrome. |
| 6. | Close input after one entry. |
